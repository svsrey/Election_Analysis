# Election_Analysis
Module 3 challenge

## Project Overview 
We were given a task from Seth and Tom to assist with the audit of the recent election that had taken place.
We were asked to provide data insights towards:
1.	The number of total votes casted
2.	Generate a list of all of the candidates in the election
3.	Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received 
4.	Calculate percentage of votes each candidate received 
5.	Come to a conclusion about whom the winner of the election was based on popular vote.

##Resouces 
Data source: election_results.csv
Software used: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio code, 1.57.1

##Findings
The election had a total of 369,711 total votes. In the election, there was a total of 3 candidates (Charles Casper Stockham, Diana Degette & Ryamon Anthony Doane). The list provided below will represent their total number of votes each candidate received along with the percentage of the total votes casted:

Charles Casper Stockham: 85,213 total votes (23.0%)
Diana DeGette: 272,892 total votes (73.8%)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 11,606 total votes (3.1%)

Based off of these findings, the conclusion about the outcome of the election is that the winner is Diana DeGette whom received 73.8% of the total votes casted.

##Future use of code 
Given this code â€“ it can work in future elections so as long as the location of the documentation is known. The path of the resources selected for this particular case is specific to the items provided to us by the electoral office. In the future, you will have to ensure that the path for the csv file is known & inputted properly so the code can run.
